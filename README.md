# Sable 2.0.3 — Stability Fixes (Rapier deadlock, removed-body crash, plot-holder crash, mass NPE)

A small [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin)-based patch mod that fixes **four** related dedicated-server
crashes in [Sable](https://modrinth.com/mod/sable) **2.0.3**'s physics and sublevel ("plot") systems, on
**NeoForge 21.1.228 / Minecraft 1.21.1**. Sable is the physics engine behind
[Create Aeronautics](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-aeronautics), Create Offroad, and other physics-driven Create
addons.

The first three share the same underlying pattern: some object (a block's physics collider, a physics body, a plot's
chunk holder) gets removed/torn down, and another part of Sable tries to use it a moment later without checking —
throwing an exception that takes the whole server down instead of just skipping that one stale reference.

## 1. Rapier physics deadlock (server freeze, not crash)

If your server froze silently (players stop moving, no chat, a crash report only appears minutes/hours later) while
a plane, vehicle, or other Sable-physics object was crashing through blocks:

```
java.lang.Error: ServerHangWatchdog detected that a single server tick took 60000004.00 seconds (should be max 0.05)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.Rapier3D.newVoxelCollider(Native Method)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.Rapier3D.createVoxelColliderEntry(Rapier3D.java:289)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.collider.RapierVoxelColliderBakery.buildPhysicsDataForBlock(RapierVoxelColliderBakery.java:60)
    ...
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.Rapier3D.step(Native Method)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.RapierPhysicsPipeline.physicsTick(RapierPhysicsPipeline.java:...)
```

The watchdog's reported elapsed time (60000004.00 seconds) is meaningless — it's not how long the tick actually
ran, it's what you get once the server thread has been permanently stuck in a native call for a long time and the
watchdog thread's own bookkeeping overflows. The real problem happened much earlier, silently.

### Root cause

`RapierPhysicsPipeline.physicsTick()` calls the native `Rapier3D.step()` function, which runs the physics
simulation inside Rapier's native (Rust) engine. While that native step is running, Rapier can call back into Java
mid-simulation — for example `FragileBlockCallback.onHit()`, which destroys a "fragile" block (leaves, bamboo,
melon, pumpkin, cactus, ice, frosted ice, lily pad — see `data/sable/tags/block/fragile.json`) that a fast-moving
physics object just hit at speed > 4.0 (`FragileBlockCallback.getTriggerVelocity()`).

Destroying that block fires Minecraft's normal block-change/neighbor-update chain, which Sable also hooks
(`RapierPhysicsPipeline.handleBlockChange()`) to keep its own voxel collider cache in sync with the world. If the
collider data for the changed block — or any of its 6 neighbors — hasn't been cached yet, `handleBlockChange()`
calls back into the native engine via `Rapier3D.newVoxelCollider()` to bake it. That's a **second** native call into
the same Rapier engine instance, made from *inside* the `step()` call that started this whole chain. Rapier's
native engine isn't reentrant for this call pair, so the second call blocks forever. The JVM can't interrupt a
native call, so nothing shows up until `ServerHangWatchdog` eventually notices the server thread never returned
from its tick and force-crashes the process.

The voxel collider cache (`net.minecraft.Util.memoize`) lives on each `RapierPhysicsPipeline` instance and is
rebuilt fresh whenever that level's physics pipeline is (re)created. The deadlock only happens the *first* time a
given block state needs baking in that pipeline's lifetime — once normal gameplay has touched a block type once,
it's cached and safe. This is why the hang is intermittent, not guaranteed on every fragile-block break.

### Fix

[`RapierPhysicsPipelineMixin`](src/main/java/dev/createfix/rapierfix/mixin/RapierPhysicsPipelineMixin.java) tracks
(per `RapierPhysicsPipeline` instance) whether execution is currently inside `physicsTick()`, and skips
`handleBlockChange()` entirely while that's true. By the time `handleBlockChange()` runs, the Minecraft-side block
change has *already* happened either way — skipping only means Sable's collider cache for that spot stays one tick
stale instead of rebuilding immediately, a tiny self-correcting gap versus freezing the whole server.

`Rapier3D.step(long, double)` is itself a **package-private native method**, so this mixin can't call/wrap it
directly from its own package (same category of problem as referencing a private member across packages — see the
[create-6.0.10-obb-collision-npe-fix](https://github.com/AleKsanDerXs/create-6.0.10-obb-collision-npe-fix) mod's
notes). Bracketing the whole (public) `physicsTick()` method instead of wrapping `step()` specifically sidesteps
that entirely.

**Confirmed working on a live server** — log captured for an `oak_leaves -> air` fragile-block destruction.

## 2. "Body has been removed" crash during world autosave

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Body has been removed
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.RapierPhysicsPipeline.assertBodyValid(RapierPhysicsPipeline.java:578)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.physics.impl.rapier.RapierPhysicsPipeline.getLinearVelocity(RapierPhysicsPipeline.java:485)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.sublevel.storage.serialization.SubLevelSerializer.serialize(SubLevelSerializer.java:62)
    at dev.ryanhcode.sable.sublevel.storage.holding.SubLevelHoldingChunkMap.saveAll(SubLevelHoldingChunkMap.java:240)
```

### Root cause

`getLinearVelocity()`/`getAngularVelocity()` both start by calling `assertBodyValid()`, which throws a plain
`RuntimeException("Body has been removed")` if the physics body was already removed (its sublevel/contraption was
disassembled or despawned). The periodic world autosave (`SubLevelHoldingChunkMap.saveAll()` →
`SubLevelSerializer.serialize()`) reads a sublevel's velocity via exactly these two methods without checking
`RigidBodyHandle.isValid()` first — a check Sable's own API already exposes for this. If a sublevel's body happens
to have been removed right before an autosave tick, the exception propagates all the way up through
`ServerLevel.save()` and crashes the *entire* tick — not just that one sublevel's save.

### Fix

The same mixin class adds two more injections: when `getLinearVelocity()`/`getAngularVelocity()` are called on an
already-removed body, they now return a zero vector instead of throwing. A removed body isn't moving anywhere, so
zero is the physically-correct answer, not just a crash-avoidance placeholder.

## 3. "Cannot change blocks in nonexistent plot holder" crash

```
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot change blocks in nonexistent plot holder
    at net.minecraft.server.level.ServerChunkCache.handler$...$sable$blockChanged(ServerChunkCache.java:2714)
    at net.minecraft.server.level.ServerChunkCache.blockChanged(ServerChunkCache.java)
    at net.minecraft.server.level.ServerLevel.sendBlockUpdated(ServerLevel.java:1071)
    at net.minecraft.world.level.block.entity.trialspawner.TrialSpawner.tickServer(TrialSpawner.java:298)
```

### Root cause

Sable represents each active sublevel (ship/contraption) as a "plot": a region of chunks at very large,
out-of-the-way coordinates in the normal overworld (this is why you'll see block positions like
`(20482989, -15, 20558967)` in the crash report — that's not corruption, it's Sable's plot allocation scheme
working as intended). A mixin on vanilla `ServerChunkCache.blockChanged` routes block-change notifications for
these coordinates to the right plot; if the position falls inside the plot coordinate space
(`SubLevelContainer.inBounds()`) but no `PlotChunkHolder` is registered for that specific chunk, Sable throws
`UnsupportedOperationException` instead of just ignoring it.

That happens when a block entity (a trial spawner, in the observed case) is still ticking inside a plot whose
holder has already been torn down — the same general "something was already removed, but another system doesn't
know it yet" race as the other two fixes above, just in Sable's plot/chunk-cache system instead of its physics
system.

### Fix

[`ServerChunkCachePlotFixMixin`](src/main/java/dev/createfix/rapierfix/mixin/ServerChunkCachePlotFixMixin.java)
replicates Sable's own bounds/holder check in a `HEAD` injection on vanilla `ServerChunkCache.blockChanged`, with a
lower Mixin priority (900 vs. the default 1000) so it runs *before* Sable's own injected check, and cancels the
method early instead of letting Sable's check throw. Silently skipping the notification for a chunk with no holder
is safe — nothing is tracking that plot chunk anymore, so there's nothing meaningful to notify.

## 4. NullPointerException building contraption properties (`sable$buildProperties`)

```
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.joml.Vector3dc.negate(org.joml.Vector3d)" because the return
value of "dev.ryanhcode.sable.api.physics.mass.MassTracker.getCenterOfMass()" is null
    at com.simibubi.create.content.contraptions.AbstractContraptionEntity.sable$buildProperties(AbstractContraptionEntity.java:3168)
    at com.simibubi.create.content.contraptions.AbstractContraptionEntity.handler$...$sable$contraptionInitialize(AbstractContraptionEntity.java:3094)
    at com.simibubi.create.content.contraptions.AbstractContraptionEntity.tick(AbstractContraptionEntity.java)
    at net.minecraft.world.entity.Entity.rideTick(Entity.java:1960)
```

### Root cause

Sable adds a mixin to Create's `AbstractContraptionEntity` that builds physics properties (mass, center of mass,
inertia) for a contraption the first time it initializes. It computes those properties with
`MassTracker.build(blockGetter, bounds)`, which scans every block in the contraption's local bounding box and
averages the mass-weighted position of every **solid** block (per `VoxelNeighborhoodState.isSolid()` — not the same
check as "is this block air"). If a contraption's bounding box contains zero solid blocks — for example a
contraption made entirely of non-solid/decorative "floating" blocks like leaves — `MassTracker.build()` correctly
returns a tracker with `mass = 0` and `centerOfMass = null`. This is a deliberate, documented (`@Nullable`) sentinel
inside Sable's own `MassTracker` class for "nothing to average" — Sable's own `addBlockMass()` method already checks
for it internally.

The bug is that `sable$buildProperties()` calls `massTracker.getCenterOfMass().negate(...)` directly, without the
same null check, to compute an offset for repositioning any floating decorative blocks in the contraption. When the
contraption has no solid blocks, that call NPEs and kills the entity's tick — and since a Create contraption entity
being ticked can't recover from an uncaught exception mid-`tick()`, it takes down the whole server tick with it.

### Fix

[`AbstractContraptionEntityMassFixMixin`](src/main/java/dev/createfix/rapierfix/mixin/AbstractContraptionEntityMassFixMixin.java)
redirects that one `getCenterOfMass()` call (scoped to just this call site, not Sable's `MassTracker` API in
general — other Sable code, like `MergedMassTracker`, relies on `null` meaning "empty tracker" and would break if
`MassTracker` itself were changed to never return null) to fall back to a zero vector when the real result is null.
A contraption with no solid blocks has no meaningful mass-based pivot to offset by anyway, so treating the offset as
zero — i.e. leaving any floating blocks at their already-set local origin — is the physically-neutral choice, not
just a crash-avoidance placeholder.

This mixin runs with a higher-than-default priority (2000 vs. Sable's default 1000) so that it's applied *after*
Sable's own mixin has already merged `sable$buildProperties` into `AbstractContraptionEntity` — otherwise the
target method wouldn't exist yet for this mixin to inject into.

## Optional logging

Disabled by default. Set `logPreventedDeadlocks = true` in `config/sable_rapier_deadlock_fix-common.toml` to log an
INFO line every time fix #1 (the Rapier reentrancy guard) actually fires — useful to confirm it's triggering on
your server:

```
[sable_rapier_deadlock_fix] Prevented a reentrant Rapier voxel-collider rebuild near (1169, 106, 1815)
(block change Block{minecraft:oak_leaves} -> Block{minecraft:air} during physicsTick) - this would have
deadlocked the server. The physics collider for this spot will refresh on the next block change nearby.
```

## Compatibility

| | |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 1.21.1 |
| Loader | NeoForge 21.1.228+ |
| Sable | 2.0.3 only (see note below) |

The mod declares a dependency on `sable` version range `[2.0.3,2.0.4)` — it will refuse to load against other
Sable versions, since these mixins target exact method signatures specific to 2.0.3. Once a Sable release fixes
these upstream, remove this mod.

## Installation

Drop the jar into `mods/` on the **server**. All four bugs are server-authoritative (world autosave, server-side
physics tick, server-side chunk cache, server-side contraption tick); installing on the client as well is harmless
but shouldn't be necessary. Requires Create (any version providing `AbstractContraptionEntity` in the same shape as
6.0.10) alongside Sable.

## Building from source

This mod compiles against Sable, its bundled `sable_rapier` native-physics module, and Create as `compileOnly` local
jar dependencies (none of them are published on a Maven repository this project pins to).

1. Grab `sable-neoforge-1.21.1-2.0.3.jar` ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/sable)) and
   `create-1.21.1-6.0.10.jar` ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)).
2. Extract `dev.ryanhcode.sable.sable-sable_rapier-1.21.1-2.0.3.jar` from Sable's `META-INF/jarjar/` folder.
3. Place all three jars in `libs/` (create the folder if it doesn't exist).
4. Run:
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

The output jar is written to `build/libs/`.

## 5. Recursive voxel-collider cache hang during chunk-section addition

Observed watchdog stack:

```text
net.minecraft.Util$8.apply
RapierVoxelColliderBakery.getPhysicsDataForBlock
RapierPhysicsPipeline.handleChunkSectionAddition
PhysicsChunkTicketManager.addTicket
```

Sable 2.0.3 uses `Util.memoize(this::buildPhysicsDataForBlock)`. A modded block's
collision-shape query can re-enter collider baking for the same `BlockState`
while its first cache entry is still being computed. The server thread then
stays inside the memoizer and the watchdog eventually terminates the server.

`RapierVoxelColliderBakeryMixin` bypasses that memoizer with an isolated,
per-bakery `ConcurrentHashMap`, computes entries outside map internals, and uses
a per-thread identity set to detect recursive `BlockState` baking. A nested
recursive request temporarily receives no collider, while the original outer
build completes and is cached. Existing mixins are unchanged.
